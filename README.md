#### Disable Browser Cache for better performance
   - you can disable the cache in Firefox by going to `about:config` and setting `network.http.use-cache` to false, but this can negatively impact performance. A better alternative for most users is to use a keyboard shortcut to bypass the cache when needed, such as `Shift + Click` the Reload button or `Ctrl+F5`, which forces a fresh download for that specific page without permanently disabling caching. For permanent disabling, you can set `network.http.use-cache` to false in `about:config`, or clear the cache automatically when you close Firefox in the settings.
